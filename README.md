## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**IDEKivyAndroid** is a custom Python IDE for Android built with **Kivy** that executes Python scripts using an **isolated native Python interpreter**. It features:

- A graphical interface for  viewing output
- Embedded Python interpreter (`mini_python`) compiled as a native executable
- Support for Pythonâ€™s `multiprocessing` module on Android
- Full integration of Python's standard library and native modules (e.g. `math`, `sqlite3`)

This makes it ideal for Python education, quick script testing, and multiprocessing demonstrations directly on Android devices

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Kivy GUI with text-based output viewer
- âœ… Embedded and user-defined script execution
- âœ… Native `mini_python` ELF binary linked with `libpython3.11.so`
- âœ… Support for `multiprocessing` using `Process`
- âœ… Dynamic extraction of `stdlib.zip` from assets
- âœ… Environment setup using Java's `ProcessBuilder`
- âœ… Custom `Recipe` for `python-for-android`

## ðŸ“± How It Works

1. **App UI** is built with Kivy (`main.py`) and embeds a script (`SCRIPT_CODE`).
2. **Python script** is written to a file (`script.py`) at runtime.
3. **mini_python**, a native ELF executable, is invoked via `ProcessBuilder`.
4. The Python environment (`PYTHONPATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, etc.) is configured dynamically.
5. Standard library is unzipped if needed (`stdlib.zip`) to support modules.
6. Script output and errors are displayed in the Kivy interface.
